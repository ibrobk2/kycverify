# Admin Login System - agentifyThe command shell you are using does not support the '&&' operator for chaining commands. Please run the commands separately in your terminal:

1. Change directory:
```
cd c:/xampp/htdocs/agentify
```

2. Run the PHP migration script:
```
php database/add-admin-table.php
```

This will create the admins table and add the initial admin user.

If you want, I can help you with any further steps or testing.
